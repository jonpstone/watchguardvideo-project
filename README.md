# A PROJECT FOR WATCHGUARD VIDEO

## DESCRIPTION

This was a project assigned to me by Watchguard Video for the purposes of technical examination for a Frontend Developer position within that organization. This app is a client side ReactJS application that consumes NASA's Mars Rover daily picture feed. The landing page produces the latest images from the Mars Rover, however the user can select a previous date using a calendar and see images from past dates.
